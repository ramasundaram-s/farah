          Dear Farah,
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          It's hard to put into words how much you mean to me. You've been more than just a friendâ€”you've been a guide, 
          a mentor, and a source of unwavering support. Your kindness, your laughter, and your belief in me have carried 
          me through some of the toughest moments of my life.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          You have this incredible gift for making people feel seen, valued, and understood. You've shown me what it means 
          to truly care, to give without expecting anything in return, and to face challenges with grace and courage.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-12">
          Now, as you step into this new chapter with your partner, my heart is filled with joy for you. Marriage is a 
          celebration of love, trust, and shared dreams, and I know that you'll bring the same compassion and light into 
          this journey that you've brought into every aspect of your life.
        </p>
